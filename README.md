# OmniEther
An Ethereum and IPFS based project to ensure transparency and security in Fund transfer.

## Central Theme: - Security and Surveillance
* __Problem to be solved:-__ Maintaining transparency and security while transferring assets (money or important data) from top level to bottom level in a hierarchical organization/system thus ensuring that all intended assets reach bottom-most level without leakage.
* __A Real Life Problem:-__  In 1985 Rajiv Gandhi said that for every 1 rupee allotted to any project,  only 15 paisa reaches to the ground level. Our Project will solve this issue seamlessly.
